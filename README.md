# Nullscape Fix
*Quick script for adding Nullscape in already existing servers!*

To use:
 - Ensure your machine can run Python
 - Install the `nullscape.py` and `requirements.txt` file
 - Enter this terminal command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Move the `nullscape.py` file to the same directory as `level.dat` (most liekly your `world` directory)
 - Run the script
 - Delete your end folder (whether it be `DIM1` or `world_the_end`)
 - Start server

This is in beta, and I plan to add a lot more features. Enjoy for now!
